# Cheat sheets

some cheat sheets of varying level of usefulness


## But how?

The source code for the documents is written in [typst](https://github.com/typst/typst). You will need to install it to compile them.

Compile a cheat sheet into .pdf:
```
typst compile ascii.typ ascii.pdf
```

Watch for changes in a document (open the pdf in a pdf reader of your choice to see changes ~live):
```
typst watch ascii.typ ascii.pdf
```
